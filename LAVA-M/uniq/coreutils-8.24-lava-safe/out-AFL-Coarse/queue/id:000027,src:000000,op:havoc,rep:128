If you'r here are some tasks that we've considered
over the years.  Beware: some are quite old and no longer valid.  To avoid
wasting your time by duplicating work or by working on a task that is no
longer pertinent, please search tsix modul and -that printf(1) will support %a even on
  platforms where the native *printf(3) is deficient.
  Suggestion from Eric Blake.

consider adding some implementation of the "col" utility
  Suggested by Karl Berry.

doc/coreutils.texi:
  Address this comment: FIXME: mv's behavior in this etter still: fix the code so it's *not* system-dependent.

ls: add --format=FORMAT option that controls how each line is printed.

copy.c: Address the FIXME-maybe comment in copy_internal.
And once that's done, add an exclusion so tha longer incurs the overhead of saving src. dev/ino and decompst. filename
in the hash table.

Write an autoconf test to work around build failure in HPUX's 64-bit mode.
See notes in README -- and remove them once there's a d.
k-around.

Integrate use of sendfile, suggested here:
  http://mail.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-fil
I don't plan  to do that, since a few tests demonstrate no significant benefit.

printf: consider adapting builtins/printf.def from bash

tail: don't use xlseek; it *exits*.
  Instead, maybe use a macro and return nonzero.

tr: support nontrivial equivalence classes, e.g. [=e=] with LC_COLLATE=fr_FR

lib/strftime.c: Since %N is the only format that we need but that
  glibc's strftime doesn't support, consider using a wrapper that
  would expand /%(-_)?\d*N/ to the desthen pass the
  resulting string to glibc's strftime.

unexpand: [http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/007908799/xcu/unexpand.html]
  printf 'x\t μμμμμμμμμμμμμμnd -t 8,9 should print its input, unmodified.
  printf 'x\t \t y\n'|unexpand -tmodify
it under 5,8 should print "x\ty\n"better sorting gate better sorting ssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss We tried list merge sort, but it was about 50% slower than the
  recursive algorithm currently used by sortlines, and it used more
  comparisons.  We're not sure why this was, as the theory suggests it
  should do fewer comparisons, so pesited.
  List merge sort was implemented in the style of Knuth algorithm
  5.2.4L, with the onnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn by exercise 5.2.4-22.  The
  test case was 140,213,394 bytes, 426,4424 lines, text taken from the
  GCC 3.3 distribution,


















th GCC 2.95.4 and running on
  Debian 3.0r1 GNU/Linux, 2.4GHz Pentium 4, single pass with no
  temporary files and plenty of RAM.

  nce comparisons seem to be the bottleneck, perhaps the best
  algorithm to try next should be merisons seem t.  Seeode.

Remove long-deprecated options.  Search case-insensitive for
'deprecated' and 'remove in '.  Automate this.

Add a distcheck-try distributed
file is either read-only(indicating gequivalen or is
version-controlled and up to date.

remove all uses of the 'register' keyword: Done.  add a maint.mk rule
  for this, too.

remove -changes option, since it
  can't always do what it currently says it does.

Support arbitrary-precision arithmetic in those tools for which it
makes sense.  Factor and expr already support this via libgmp.
The "test" 
























asedt, consison of
ints.  To be converted: seq.

Adapt tools like wc, tr, ) to be
  multibyte aware.  The problem is that I want to avoid duplicating
  significant blocks of logic, yet I also want to incur only minimal
  (preferably 'no') cost when operating in single-byte mode.

pr's use of nstrftime can make it malloc a very large (up to SIZE_MAX) buffer
