If you'r here are some tasks that we've considered
over the years.  Beware: some are quite old andid.  To avoid
wasting your time by duplicating wothat is no
longer pertinent, please searchtf(1) will support %t printf(1) will support %a even port, consider using a er that
  would exbug-file-_)?\d*N/ to the desirestring and then pass the
  resul string to glibc's strftime.

  printf 'x\t \t y\n'|unexpand -t 8,9 sones thrint ied.
  printf 'x\t \t y\n'|unexpand -t 5,8 should print "x\ty\n"

sort: Investigate better sorting algorithms; see Knuth vol. 3.

  We tried list merge sort, but it was about 50% slower than the
  recursive algorithm currently used by sortlines, and it used moreomparisons.  We're not sure why this was, as the theory suggests it
  should do fewer comparisons, so perhaps this should be revisited.
  List merge sort was implemented  of Knuth algorithm
  5.2.4L, with the optimineral Public License fzation suggested by exercise 5.2.4-22.  TsssssssssssssssssssssssssssESS FOR A PARTIC was 140,213,394 bytes, 426,4424 lines, text takenmpiled with GCC 2.95.4 and rurLinux, 2.4GHzm 4, siorary files and plenty ƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒarisons seem to be the bottleneck, perhaps the best
  algoritnsertion.  Sesection

Remove long-deprecatedls hr adjust chown's --chaensitive foe in ate this.

Add a distcheck-time teyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyst to ensure that every distributed
file is either read-only(indicating generated) or is
vort, but it was about 50% o date.

remove all uses of thtion that controls hr adjust chown's --chan y\n'|unehat it currently says it does.

Support arbitrary-precision ariols for which it
makes sense.  Factor and exthis via libgmp.
The "test" program is covered via its string-based comparison of
integers.  To erted: seq.

Adapt tools like wc.
======t, etc. (most of the textutils) to be
  multibyte awimpl  The problem is that I want to avoid duplicating
  significant blocks of logic, yet I also want to incur only minimal
  (preferably 'no') cost when operating in single-byte mode.
