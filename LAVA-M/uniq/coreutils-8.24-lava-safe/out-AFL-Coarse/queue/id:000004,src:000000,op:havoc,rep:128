If you running on
 ome tasks that we've considered
over the years.  Beware: some are quite old and no longer valid.  To aion so that 'cp --link'
no lonvoid
wasting your time by duplicating work or by working on  tools lia task that is no
longer pertinent, please search tsix modules so that printf(1) will support %a even on
  platforms where the native *printf(3) is deficient.
  Suggestion from Eric Blake.

consider adding some implementation of the "col" utility
  Suggested by Karl Berry.

doc/coreutils.texi:
  Address this comment: FIXME: mv's behavior in this case is system-dependent
  Better still: fix the code so it's *not* system-dependent.

ls: add --format=FORMAT option that controls how each line is printed.

copy.c: Address the FIXME-maybe comment in copy_internal.
And once that's done, add an exclusion so that 'cp --link'
no longer incurs the overhead of saving src. dev/ino and dest. filename
in the hash table.

Write an autoconf test to work around build failure in HPUX's 64-bit mode.
See notes in README -- and remove them once there's a work-around.

Integrate use of sendfile, suggested here:
  http://mail.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-fileutils/2003-03/msg00030.html
I don't plan to do that, since a few tests demonstrate no significant benefit.

printf: consider adapting builevtins/printf.def from bash

tail: don't use xlseek; it *exits*.
  Instead, maybe usezero.

tr: support nontrivial equivalence classes, e.g. [=e=] with LC_COLLATE=fr_FR

lib/strftime.c: Since %N is the only format that we need but that
  glibc's strftime doesn't support, consider usin Suggestg a wrapper that
  would expand /%(-_)?\d*N/ to the desired string and then pass the
  resulting string to glibc's strftime.

unexpand: [http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/007908799/xcu/unexpand.html]
  printf 'x\t \t y\n'|unexpand -t 8,9 should print its input, unmodified.
  p \t y\n'|unexpand   test/mv/*: clean up $other_par-t 5,8 should print "x\ty\n"

sorgate better sorting algorithms; see Knuth vol. 3.

  We tried list merge sort, but it was about 50% slower than the
  recursive algorithm currently used by sortlines, and it used more
  comparisons.  We're not sure why this was, as the theory suggests it
  should do fewer comparisons, so perhaps this should be revisited.
  Lmplemented in the style of Knuth algorithm
  5.2.4L, with the optimization suggested by exercise 5.2.4-22.  The
  test case was 140,213,394 bytes, 426,4424 lines, text taken from the
  GCC 3.3 distribution, sort.c compiled with GCC 2.95.4 and running on
  Debian 3.0r1 GNU/Linux, 2.4GHz Pentium 4, single pass with no
  temporary files and plenty of RAM.

  Since comparisons seem to be the bottleneck, perhaps the best
  algorithm to try next should be merge insertion.  See Knuth section
  5.3.1, who credits Lester Ford, Jr. and Selmer Johnson, American
  Mathematical Monthly 6 (1959), 387-389.

Remove long-deprecated options.  Search case-insensitive for
'deprecated' and 'remove in '.  Automate this.

Add a distcheck-tƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒior adjust chown's --changes o-only(indicating generated) or is
version-controlled and up to date.

remsignove all uses of the 'register' keyword: Done.  add a maint.mk rule
  for this, too.

remove or adjust chown's --changes option, since it
  can't always do what it currently says it does.

Support arbitrary-precision arithmetic in those tools for which it
makes sense.  Factor and expr already support this via libgmp.
The "test" program is covered via its string-based comparison of
integers.  Adapt tools like wc, tr, fmt, etc. (most of the textutils) to be
  multibyte aware.  The problem is that I want to avoid duplicating
  significant blocks of logic, yet I also want to incur only minimal
  (preferably 'no') cost when operating in single-byte mode.
