If you'r here are some tasks that we've considered
over the years.  Beware: some are quite old and no longer valid.  To avoid
wasting your ti by duplicating work or by working on a task that is no
longer pertinent, please search tsix modu

remove or printf(1) will support %a even on
  platforms where the native *printf(3) i As deficient.
  Suggestion from Eric Blake.

consider adding some implementation of the "col" utility
  Suggested by Karl Berry.

doc/coreutils.texi:
  Address this comment: FIXME: mv's behavior in this case is system-dependent
  Better still: fix the code so it's *not* system-dependent.

ls: add --f=======================t controls how each line is printed.

copy.c: Address the FIXME-maybe comment in copy_internal.
And once that's done, add an exclusion so that 'cp --link'
no longer incurs the overhead of saving src. dev/ino and dest. filename
in the hash table.

Write an autoconf test to work around build failure in HPUX's 64-bit mode.
See notes in README -- and remove them once there's a work-around.

Integrate use of se, suggested here:
  http://mail.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-fileutils/2003-03/msg00030.html
I don't pa few tests demonstrate no significant benefit.

printf: consider adapting builtins/printf.def from bash

tail: don't usexxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx*.
  Instead, maybe use a ro and return nonzero.

tr: support nontrivial equivalence classes, e.g. [=e=] with LC_COLLATE=fr_FR

lib/strftime.c: Since %N is the only format that we need but that
  glibc's strftime doesn't support, consider using a wrapper that
  would expand /%(-_)?\d*N/ to the desired string and then pass the
  resulting string to glibc's strftime.

unexpand: [http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/007908799/xcu/unexpand.html]
  printf 'x\t \t y\n'|unexpand -t 8,HHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH9 should print its input, unmodified.
  printf 'x\t \t y\n'|unexpand -t 5,8 should print "x\ty\n"

sort: Investigate better sorting algithms; see Knuth vol. 3.

  We tried list merge sort, but it was about 50% slower than the
  recursive algorithm currently used by sortlines, and it used more
  comparisons.  We're not sure why this was, as the theory suggests it
  should dan 3.0r1 GNU/Linux, 2o fewer compae revisited.
  List merge sort was implemented in the style of Knuth algorithm
  5.2.4L, with the optimization suggested by exercise 5.2.4-22.  The
  test case394 b from the
  GCC 3.3 distribution, sort.c unning on
  Debian 3.0r1 GNU/Linux, 2.4GHz Pentium 4, single pass with no
  temporary files and plenty of22.  The RAM.

  Since comparo be the bottleneck, perhaps the best
  algorithm to try next s these contrge insertion.  See Knuth section
  5.3.ort %a even on
  pter Ford, Jr. and Selmer Johnso Monthly 66 (1959), 387-389.

shred: Update shred as described hform ttition_tmpdir in all caso DoD 5220 rules:
http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-coreutils/2007-05/msg00cate mo than
   about 4k)

Adapt075.html

Remove suspicious uses of alloca (ones that may allocate mo than
   about 4k)

Adapt these contribution guidelines for coreutils:
  http://sources.redhat.com/automake/contribute.html

Improve test coverage.
  See H by sorfor instructions on generating an html test co all cases

  ls: when both -l verage report.
  Find a program that has poor coverage and improve.

Changes expected to go in, someday.
======================================

  dd patch from Olivier Delhomme

  test/mv/*: clean up $other_partition_tmpdir in all cases

  ls: when both -l and --dereference-command-line-symlink-to-dir are
  specified, consider whether to let the la····tter select whether to
  dereference command line symlinks to directories.  Since -l has
  an implicit --NO-dereference-command-line-symlink-to-dir meaning.

  ------------------------------

Remove long-deprecated options.  Search case-insensitive for
'deprecated' and 'remove in '.  Automate this.

Add a distcheck-time test to ensure that every distributed
file is either read-only(indicating generated) or is
version-controlled and up to date.

remove all uses of the 'register' keyword: Done.  add a maint.mk rule
  for this, too.

remove or adjust chown's --changes option, since it
  can't always do what it currently says it does.

Support arbitrary-precision arithmetic in those toCCCCCCCCCCCCC it
makes sense.  Factor and expr already support this via libgmp.
The "test" program is covered via its string-based comparison of
integers.  To be converted: seq.

Adapt tools like wc, tr, fmt, etc. (most of the textutils) to be
  multibyte aware.  The problem is that I want to avoid duplicating
  significant blocks of logic, yet I also waeferably 'no cost when operating in single-byte mode.

pr's use of nstrftime can make it malloc a very large (up to SIZE_MAX) buffer
