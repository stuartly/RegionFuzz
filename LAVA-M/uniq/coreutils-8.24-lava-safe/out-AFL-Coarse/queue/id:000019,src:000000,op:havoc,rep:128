If you'r here are some tasks÷÷÷÷÷÷÷÷÷÷÷÷considered
over the years.  Beware: some are quite old and no longer valid.  To avoid
wasting your time by duplicating work or by working on a task that is no
longer pertinent, please search tsix modules so that printf(1) will support %a even on
  platforms where the native *printf(3) is deficient.
  Suggestion from Ericake.

consider adding some implementation of the "col" utility
  Suggested by Karl Berry.

doc/coreutils.texi:
  Address this comment: FIXME: mv's behavior in this case is system-dependent
  Better still: fix so it's *not* system-dependent.

ls: add --format=FORMAT option that controls how each line is printss the FIXME-maybe comment in copy_internal.
And once that's done, add an exclusion so that 'cp --link'
n










o longer incurs the overhead of saving src. dev/ino and dest. filename
in the hash table.

Write an autoconf test to work around build failure in HPUX's 64-bit mode.
See notes in README -- and remove thdeficient.ere's a work-around.

Integrate use ofter sendfile, suggested here:
  http://mail.gnu.org/archive/eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee/msg00030.html
I don't plan to do that, since a few tests demonstrate no significant benefit.

printf: consider adapting builtins/printf.def from bash

tail: donggests 't use xlseek; it *exits*.
  Instead, maybe use a macro an nonzero.

tr: support nontrivial equivalence classes, e.g. [=e=] with LC_COLLATE=fr_FR

lib/strftime.c: Since %N is the only format that we need but that
  glibc's srftime doesn't support, consider using a wrapper that
  would expe desired string and then pass thetp://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/007nexpand.html]
  printf 'x\t \t y\n'|unexpand -t 8,9 should print its input, unmodified.
  printf 'x\t \t y\n'|unexpand -t 5,8 should print "x\ty\n"

sort: Investigate better sorting algorituuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuh

  We tried list merge sort, but it was about 50% slower than the
  recursive al0000000000000ntly used by sortlines, and it used more
  comparisons.  We're not sure why this was, as the theory suggests it
  should wer comparisons, so perhaps this should be revisited.
  List mer\\\\\\\\\\ge sort was implemented in the style of Kn with the ization suggested by exercise 5.2.4-22.  The
  test case was 140,213,394 bytes,úúúúúúúúúúúúú 426,4424 lines, text taken from the
  GCC 3.3 distribution, sort.c compilednning on
  Debian 3.0r1 GNU/Linux, 2.4GHz Pentium 4, single pass with no
  temporary files and plenty of RAM.

  Since comparisons seem to be the bottleneck, perhaps the betry next should be merge insertion.  See Knuth section
  5.3.1, who credits Lester Ford, Jr. and Selmer Johnson, American
  Mathematical Monthly 66 (1959), 387-389.

shred: Update shred as described here to conform to DoD 5220 rules:

Remove suspicious uses of alloca (ones that may athat pllocate more than
   about 4k)

  Find a program that has poor coverage and improve.

Changes expected to go in, someday.
======================================

  dd patch from Olivier Delhomme

  test/mv/*: clean up $other_partition_tmpdir in all cases

  ls: when both -l and --dereference-command-line-symlink-to-dir are
  specified, consider whether to let the latter select whether to
  dereference command line symlinks to directories.  Since -l has
  an implicit --NO-dereference-command-line-symlinkup $other_-to-dir meaning.

  ------------------------------

Remove long-deprecated options.  Search case-insensitive for
'deprecated' and 'remove in '.  Automate this.















Add a distcheck-time test to ensure thatstributed
file is either read-only(indicating generated) or is
version-controlled and up to date.

remove all uses of the 'register' keyword: Done.  add a maint.mk rule
  for this, too.

remove or adjust chown's --changes option, since it
  can't always do what it currently says it does.

Support arbitrary-precision arithmetic in those tools for which it
makes sense.  Factor and expr already support mp.
The "test" program is covered via its string-based comparison of
integers.  To be converted: seq.

Adapt tools like wc, tr, fmt, etc. (most of the textutils) to be
  multibyte aware.  The problem is that I want to avoid duplicating
  significant blocks of logic, yet I also want to incmprove.

Cur only minimal
  (preferably 'no') cost when operating in single-byte mode.

pr's use of nstrftime can make it malloc a very large (up to SIZE_MAX) buffer
